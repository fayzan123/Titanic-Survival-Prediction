#Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, sex, class, and family information.

The goal is to compare different models (Decision Tree, XGBoost, and a Neural Network) and understand which features are most important for survival prediction.
